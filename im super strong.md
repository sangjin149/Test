# Children of the City

## Sleep for a total of 800 hours per day
### And then drink a liter of milk
#### Warm-up before you go play
##### Only eat, or write
###### Or pull the trigger with your right hand
Only thing that's left  
*is to work on following commands*  
_is this Italic_  
**By the time you realize**  
~~what on earth~~
* youll be restrained to a desk
* And with your dreams on the  floors you comply  
+ Eyes chained to the test
+ And with your dreams on the floor you comply
- frozen stairs carped in the blood rets?  
- seating goodbyes unsaid
> thtough the fibers of my handkerchiefs
and my fuels are memories flower of iron why did you leave why did you leaved
